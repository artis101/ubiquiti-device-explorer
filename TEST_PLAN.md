# Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive test coverage plan for the application, designed to ensure its reliability, functionality, and maintainability. The strategy follows the industry-standard "Testing Pyramid" model, prioritizing efficient and effective testing at various levels.

---

## 1. Unit Tests

**Goal:** To verify that the smallest, most isolated pieces of code (individual functions, components, or modules) function correctly in isolation.

**What to Test:**

*   **Utility Functions (`src/utils/`):**
    *   `search.ts`: Verify accurate filtering with various queries and edge cases.
    *   `productLines.ts`: Confirm correct processing and structuring of product line data.
    *   `imageFallback.ts`: Ensure proper handling of missing image URLs.

*   **Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/`):**
    *   `useDebounce.ts`: Validate that values are updated only after the specified delay.
    *   `useUrlState.ts`: Confirm correct reading from and writing to URL query parameters.
    *   `useHighlightIndices.ts`: Ensure accurate identification of text segments for highlighting in search results.

*   **Simple UI Components (`src/components/ui/`):**
    *   `CopyButton.tsx`: Test rendering and click event functionality.
    *   `ToggleSwitch.tsx`: Verify correct state display (on/off) and responsiveness to user interaction.
    *   `Highlight.tsx`: Ensure correct wrapping of matching text with appropriate HTML tags.

## 2. Integration Tests

**Goal:** To ensure that different modules or services within the application interact and work together correctly as a cohesive group.

**What to Test:**

*   **Search and Filtering Flow (`src/components/search/`):**
    *   Verify that input in `SearchInput` correctly filters data displayed by `DeviceList` or `DeviceGrid`.
    *   Confirm that selecting options in `ProductLineDropdown` accurately filters displayed devices.
    *   Ensure `SearchResultsCount` updates precisely based on active search and filter criteria.

*   **Device View Management (`src/components/device/`):**
    *   Test `ViewModeSwitcher` to confirm correct rendering of `DeviceList` or `DeviceGrid` upon view mode changes.
    *   Validate that `DeviceDetails` page correctly aggregates and displays information from its sub-components (`DeviceOverview`, `DeviceAttributes`, etc.) for a given device ID.

*   **Data Contexts (`src/contexts/`):**
    *   Verify that components wrapped by `UidbProvider` can successfully access and display device data via the `useUidb` hook.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Goal:** To simulate complete user journeys through the application, from start to finish, ensuring all integrated systems function seamlessly in a real browser environment.

**Key User Scenarios to Test:**

*   **Scenario 1: Search and View Device Details**
    1.  User navigates to the application's home page.
    2.  User types a device name (e.g., "router") into the search bar.
    3.  The displayed device list dynamically updates to show only matching results.
    4.  User clicks on a specific device card from the search results.
    5.  The application successfully navigates to the detailed view page for that device, displaying its image, attributes, and all relevant information.

*   **Scenario 2: Filter and Change View Mode**
    1.  User loads the application page.
    2.  User applies a filter by selecting a product line from the dropdown.
    3.  The device list updates to display only devices belonging to the selected product line.
    4.  User then switches the view mode (e.g., from list to grid view).
    5.  The layout changes as expected (e.g., from a table to a grid of cards) while maintaining the applied filter.

## 4. Accessibility Tests

**Goal:** To ensure the application is usable and accessible to individuals with disabilities, adhering to web accessibility standards.

**What to Test:**

*   **Automated Checks:**
    *   Integrate an automated accessibility testing tool (e.g., `axe-core`) into the test suite to scan for common issues such as missing image `alt` text, insufficient color contrast, and improper ARIA attributes.

*   **Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Manually test the entire application's navigability using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Spacebar).
    *   Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) are reachable, focusable, and operable via keyboard input.
